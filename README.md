# Bank-Default-Prediction-and-Equity-Return-Clustering-Machine-Learning

The first section of this notebook covers the prediction of bank defaults using 3 different supervised machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forests.

The second section explores using unsupervised clustering algorithms (K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering) to explore if certain industries of equity returns tend to cluster together, particulary when comparing bull and bear market years.

Accompanying report graded 87% for Machine Learning with Applications in Finance module.
